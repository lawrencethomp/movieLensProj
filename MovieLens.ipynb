    "\n",
    "There's too much data in the Movie Lens Database to be able to make major conclusions about the opinions from people who \n",
    "rate movies on the website by a cursory glance-- the review csv is 20 million lines alone! That'll crash most versions of Microsoft Office if not wholly render them useless. \n",
    "\n",
    "It hasn't really been established what factors can help predict whether whether MovieLens users would enjoy a movie or dislike it. From what the data shows, MovieLens users are very much male -- a previous data set sampled 6040 users, with an output of around 71% male, aged 30 and a half years old. It would probably be safe to say that these men happen to be [largely white](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-no-surprise-at-all-new-study-says-most-1528730858-htmlstory.html), which is who came to the website to review, so that might be an indicator of what they enjoy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, they're the coveted 18-34 demographic that largely has a lot of disposable income, and we're asking the question: _what do these guys like?_ How will this determine some of our hypotheses? They won't be the same as if we grabbed some guys off the street or your brother/husband/friend etc; this is a subset of guys who think about movies enough to go onto a niche website and contribute their opinions.\n",

    "    \n",

    "From sampling over 27k movies, the average score of a movieLens movie is 3.07. Movies will be explored to see whether or not they scored above this threshold.\n"

    "## The Solution:\n",
    "***\n",
    "Use Linear Regression. [Linear Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-linear-regression-14c4e325882a) is the \"modeling of a target value based on independent predictors\". The value we're looking to obtain is whether the movie scored above or below the median average, the dependent variable, based off of factors such as the genre, awards, year, appearance on lists.\n",
    "\n",

    "    pandas dataset, and lives persistently in a database, but without the tradeoff of the largesse of a relational \n",
    "    database, which has its home in another project type.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   PyMongo and the Python language in general was chosen as the programming language due to language uniformity. Jupyter \n",
    "    Notebook, numpy, and pandas are all very Python friendly -- if not built in Python, and thus to save time, the database\n",
    "    should be interacted with in Python, as well. Python can strongly parse a csv sheet compared to JavaScript, for \n",
    "    instance, which requires that csv be installed via NodeJS.  The code shows that Python is very much a scripting language\n",
    "    and needs to be refactored to use design patterns and respect DRY -- don't repeat yourself.\n",

    "   This dataset is also an amalgamation of serveral different types of data -- using the id of the movieLens movie, we were\n",

    "    datasets. Some of the other datasets also include .dat and .tsv files, where adding them in before into the database is \n",
    "    far easier than parsing at the point of transaction. Given that this set has parsed 20 million reviews into around 25k \n",

    "        scraped/processed.\n",
    "        movies.csv - a list of all movies titles, ids, and genres.\n",

    "*Budget*: Including the budget of the movie adjusted for inflation for 2018 would have been a scraping project -- searching IMDB for the budget of an id, passing it into Mongo, and then using that to determine the budget. This approach didn't account for the indie darlings, and would have required more care beyond the scope of project.<br> <br>\n",
    "*Director*: Getting something like the director is similar to the issues relating to the budget -- more effort to get involved with, and due to directors releasing duds sometimes, not worth it. <br> <br>\n",
    "*Golden Raspberry*: The golden raspberry awards are an awards ceremony trafficing in jokes and superlatives for the worst movies. Many of these awards were jokes, and some of the movies that they declared bad, actually became fan favorites later on. Due to the small selection of movies and short amount of time in existence, the Golden Raspberry might not have beneficial.<br> <br>\n",
    "*FilmStruck*: All the legends from the Turner Classic Movies and Criterion Collection on a now defunct streaming service. Getting these in would involve a combination of string manipulation and website scraping. To assess if this would be worthwhile, movies from the Turner collection were examined for IMDB scores and whether they'd be over or under. Largely, The movies tended to be over, but were not as uniform as the IMDB top 250. Not worth it for the scope of the project vs. the result.<br>\n",

    "*Genres*: The number of genres in a movie determines whether or not it's the much maligned \"genre film\" -- the scholcky horror movie or the derivative action movie, which used to be relegated to the dustbin of history, but thanks to the era of the database, we are haunted with for as long as people care. It seems that having more genres of movies will create a more nuanced movie, making it score over the average. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Year*: Time is a filter, and movies get forgotten, or had limited runs, or aren't available on video/streaming. So modern audiences can't review them for a database. As a result, newer movies, because they are not lost to the aether, are easier to write bad reviews for. A classic movie is defined as anything before 1980, when Spielberg became very known, and it could be said that the auteur director got reigned in. If the movie year > 1980 , it qualifies as a classic movie <br><br>\n",
