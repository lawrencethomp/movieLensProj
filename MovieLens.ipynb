    "There's too much data in the Movie Lens Database to be able to make major conclusions about the opinions from people who \n",

    "\n",
    "It hasn't really been established what factors can help predict whether whether MovieLens users would enjoy a movie or dislike it. From what the data shows, MovieLens users are very much male -- a previous data set sampled 6040 users, with an output of around 71% male, aged 30 and a half years old. It would probably be safe to say that these men happen to be [largely white](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-no-surprise-at-all-new-study-says-most-1528730858-htmlstory.html), which is who came to the website to review, so that might be an indicator of what they enjoy. \n",

    "Simply put, they're the coveted 18-34 demographic that largely has a lot of disposable income, and we're asking the question: _what do these guys like?_ How will this determine some of our hypotheses?

    "***\n",
    "Use Linear Regression. [Linear Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-linear-regression-14c4e325882a) is the \"modeling of a target value based on independent predictors\". The value we're looking to obtain is whether the movie scored above or below the median average, the dependent variable, based off of factors such as the genre, awards, year, appearance on lists.\n",

    "    database, which has its home in another project type.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   PyMongo and the Python language in general was chosen as the programming language due to language uniformity. Jupyter \n",

    "        scraped/processed.\n",
    "        movies.csv - a list of all movies titles, ids, and genres.\n",

    "***\t\n",

    "*Budget*: Including the budget of the movie adjusted for inflation for 2018 would have been a scraping project -- searching IMDB for the budget of an id, passing it into Mongo, and then using that to determine the budget. This approach didn't account for the indie darlings, and would have required more care beyond the scope of project.<br> <br>\n",
    "*Director*: Getting something like the director is similar to the issues relating to the budget -- more effort to get involved with, and due to directors releasing duds sometimes, not worth it. <br> <br>\n",
    "*Golden Raspberry*: The golden raspberry awards are an awards ceremony trafficing in jokes and superlatives for the worst movies. Many of these awards were jokes, and some of the movies that they declared bad, actually became fan favorites later on. Due to the small selection of movies and short amount of time in existence, the Golden Raspberry might not have beneficial.<br> <br>\n",
    "*FilmStruck*: All the legends from the Turner Classic Movies and Criterion Collection on a now defunct streaming service. Getting these in would involve a combination of string manipulation and website scraping. To assess if this would be worthwhile, movies from the Turner collection were examined for IMDB scores and whether they'd be over or under. Largely, The movies tended to be over, but were not as uniform as the IMDB top 250. Not worth it for the scope of the project vs. the result.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features we Implemented**\n",
    "***\t\n",
    "\n",
    "*Genres*: The number of genres in a movie determines whether or not it's the much maligned \"genre film\" -- the scholcky horror movie or the derivative action movie, which used to be relegated to the dustbin of history, but thanks to the era of the database, we are haunted with for as long as people care. It seems that having more genres of movies will create a more nuanced movie, making it score over the average. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Year*: Time is a filter, and movies get forgotten, or had limited runs, or aren't available on video/streaming. So modern audiences can't review them for a database. As a result, newer movies, because they are not lost to the aether, are easier to write bad reviews for. A classic movie is defined as anything before 1980, when Spielberg became very known, and it could be said that the auteur director got reigned in. If the movie year > 1980 , it qualifies as a classic movie <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Awards*: Movies that won Oscars are more likely to have scored better than other movies that didn't. Comparing the score of movies that did to movies that didn't will show this.\n",
